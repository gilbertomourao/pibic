# PYNQ Project

This directory contains the PYNQ drivers to interact with the PL and some examples. A test was performed with a Logitech c270 webcam. The FPGA algorithm outperformed the OpenCV functions. The camera was at the same position both in the hardware and software tests. To see the results, check the notebook.
